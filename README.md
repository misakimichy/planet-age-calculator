# Super Galactic Age Calculator

#### _Intermediate JavaScript - week 2 solo project: Super Galactic Age Calculator, 9/6/2019_

## Description
Build a Super Galactic Age Calculator using TDD

Create a website for a Super Galactic Age Calculator that calculate a user age to other planets' age and show how many years a user has left to live on each planet.


## Website should have:
The business logic of your application should take a personâ€™s age in years and create a class that does the following:

- Returns their age in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is **.24 Earth years**.)

- Returns their age in Venus years. (A Venus year is **.62 Earth years**.)

- Returns their age in Mars years. (A Mars year is **1.88 Earth years**.)

- Returns their age in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is **11.86 Earth years**.)

- Determines how many years a user has left to live on each planetâ€¦ðŸ¤­ 
  - The application will have to calculate the userâ€™s life expectancy. You can determine average life expectancy as you see fit. 
  - A simple way to do this would be to have the user input the average life expectancy for their demographic.
  - A more involved way to do this would be to collect other information from the user (e.g. lifestyle, country of residence, activity level, etc.) to determine their life expectancy.

- If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy.


### Specs

- If a user choose a country, output will be the selected country's life expectancy.

- If a user doesn't choose a country, alert will pop up.

- If a user type age, select a country and choose a planet, they'll get two output: convert the age into the planet age and years to live in other planet based on the selected country's life expectancy.
